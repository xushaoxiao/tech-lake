## 五大基本概念

```mermaid
graph LR;
    五大基本概念 --> 主语;
    五大基本概念 --> 谓语;
    五大基本概念 --> 宾语;
    五大基本概念 --> 表语;
    五大基本概念 --> 宾补;
    主语 --> A(放在谓语动词之前的成分就叫做主语);
    谓语 --> B(谓语就是动词, 动词主要分为`实意动词`和`系动词`);
    宾语 --> C(放在实意动词之后的成分就叫做宾语);
    表语 --> D(放在系动词之后的成分就叫表语);
    宾补 --> E(补充说明宾语的成分就叫做宾补);
```

1. 主语
放在谓语动词之前的成分就叫做主语。

2. 谓语
谓语就是动词，动词主要分为`实意动词`和`系动词`

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        谓语动词 --> 1.实意动词;
        谓语动词 --> 2.系动词;
        谓语动词 --> 3.助动词;
        谓语动词 --> 4.情态动词;
        1.实意动词 --> 具备实际动作意义;
        2.系动词 --> be动词;
        2.系动词 --> 和be功能一样的动词;
        3.助动词 --> be,have,has,had,do,did;
        4.情态动词 --> can,may,must,should,would;
    ```

    1. 实意动词：具备实际动作意义
    2. 系动词
        1. be动词包含：is am are was were
        2. 和be功能一样的动词
    3. 助动词包含：be、has、hava、had、do、did（时态语态相关）
    4. 情态动词包含：can、may、must、should、would

    ```text
    例句：
    1. I love you.
    2. To see is to believe.
    3. The flower smells great.
    4. Being able to love you is the happest thing in this world.
    ```

3. 宾语
放在实意动词之后的成分就叫做宾语。

4. 表语
放在系动词之后的成分就叫做表语。

5. 宾补
补充说明宾语的成分就叫做宾补。

    ```text
    1. I find you beautiful.
    2. I consider him a liar.
    3. I hear her signing.
    ```

    >Tip：
    >
    >>如果宾语和宾语之后的成分加be动词后能够构成一个逻辑完整的句子，则宾语之后的成分为宾补。

    思维导图：

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        主语+谓语 --> 实意动词;
        主语+谓语 --> 系动词;
        实意动词 --> 宾语;
        系动词 --> 表语;
        宾语 --> 宾补;
    ```

## 五大基本句型

1. 主语 + 谓语

    e.g. I arrived / The rain stopped.

2. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语

    e.g. I love you.

3. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾语

    e.g. My mum bought me a drink.

4. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾补

    e.g. I find you beautiful.

5. 主语 + 系动词 + 表语

    e.g. I am good.

>> 2.一个句子的主干有且仅有一个谓语动词

### 补充定义

定语和状语

1. 状语

    除去五大基本概念和形容词（定语）剩下的部分就是状语。

    教科书定义：说明地点、时间、原因、目的、结果、条件、方向、程度、方式和伴随状况等的句子叫做状语。

    >Tip:
    >
    >>介词短语几乎都是状语

2. 定语
形容词

## 并列句的起源与本质

简单句 + 并列连词 + 简单句.

You are nice but i don't love you.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    并列连词 --> and;
    and --> A(He helped me and i helped him.);
    并列连词 --> or;
    or --> B(You can watch TV or you can do exercise.);
    并列连词 --> but;
    but --> C(You are nice but i don't love you.);
```

## 名词性定语从句的起源与本质

一个句子做了名词的功能就叫做名词性从句。

```mermaid
    graph LR;
        名词性从句 --> 主语从句;
        名词性从句 --> 宾语从句;
        名词性从句 --> 表语从句;
        名词性从句 --> 同位语从句;
        主语从句 -- 陈述句 --> A1(变形规则:That + 陈述句);
        主语从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> A2(变形规则:Whether + 一般疑问句陈述语序);
        主语从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> A3(变形规则:特殊疑问词 + 特殊疑问句陈述语序);
        宾语从句 -- 陈述句 --> B1["变形规则:(That) + 陈述句,宾语从句中that可省略"];
        宾语从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> B2(变形规则:Whether/If + 一般疑问句陈述语序,宾语从句中whether可用if替换);
        宾语从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> B3(变形规则:特殊疑问词 + 特殊疑问句陈述语序);
        表语从句 -- 陈述句 --> C1[变形规则:That + 陈述句];
        表语从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> C2(变形规则:Whether/If + 一般疑问句陈述语序);
        表语从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> C3(变形规则:特殊疑问词 + 特殊疑问句陈述语序);
        同位语从句 -- 陈述句 --> D1[变形规则:That + 陈述句];
        同位语从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> D2(变形规则:Whether/If + 一般疑问句陈述语序);
        同位语从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> D3(变形规则:特殊疑问词 + 特殊疑问句陈述语序);
```

### 规则

1. 变化规则：that + 陈述句 = 名词

    That Yaoming is tall is a fact.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        名词性从句 -- 陈述句 --> 主语从句;
        主语从句 --> A(That Yaoming is tall is a fact.);
        名词性从句 -- 陈述句 --> 宾语从句;
        宾语从句 --> B["We know (that) Yaiming is tall."];
        名词性从句 -- 陈述句 --> 表语从句;
        表语从句 --> C(My option is that Yaoming is tall.);
        名词性从句 -- 陈述句 --> 同位语从句;
        同位语从句 --> D(The option that Yaoming is tall is right.);
    ```

2. 变化规则：if/whether + 一般疑问句的陈述语序 = 名词

    一般疑问句：Will you come to Bejing tomorrow?

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        名词性从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> 主语从句;
        主语从句 --> 1.你明天是否来北京对我来说很重要.;
        主语从句 --> A(Whether you will come to Bejing tomorrow is impotant to me.);
        名词性从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> 宾语从句;
        宾语从句 --> 2.我想知道你明天是否来北京.;
        宾语从句 --> B(I want to know if/whether you will come to Bejing tomorrow.);
        名词性从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> 表语从句;
        表语从句 --> 3.我的问题是你明天是否来北京.;
        表语从句 --> C(My question is whther you will come to Bejing tomorrow.);
        名词性从句 -- 一般疑问句 --> 同位语从句;
        同位语从句 --> 4.你明天是否来北京这个问题让我很烦心.;
        同位语从句 --> D(The question whether you will come to Bejing tomorrow bothers me.);
    ```

3. 变化规则：陈述语序的特殊疑问句 = 名词

    特殊疑问句：Why are you so clever.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        名词性从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> 主语从句;
        主语从句 --> 1.你为什么这么聪明是一个谜.;
        主语从句 --> A(Why you are so clever is a mystery.);
        名词性从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> 宾语从句;
        宾语从句 --> 2.我们不知道你为什么这么聪明.;
        宾语从句 --> B(We don't know why you are so clever.');
        名词性从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> 表语从句;
        表语从句 --> 3.我的问题是你为什么这么聪明.;
        表语从句 --> C(My question is why you are so clever.);
        名词性从句 -- 特殊疑问句 --> 同位语从句;
        同位语从句 --> 4.你为什么这么聪明这个问题让我感兴趣.;
        同位语从句 --> D(The question why you are so clever interest.);
    ```

4. 特殊疑问词

    ```mermaid
       graph LR;
       特殊疑问词 --> 人-2;
       特殊疑问词 --> 物-2;
       特殊疑问词 --> 特殊-3;
       特殊疑问词 --> How-1;
       人-2 --> Who;
       人-2 --> Whose;
       物-2 --> Which;
       物-2 --> What;
       特殊-3 --> When;
       特殊-3 --> Where;
       特殊-3 --> Why;
       How-1 --> How;
    ```

>Tips:
>
>>1. 在句子中遇到“抽象名词”时，应条件反射地想到后面可能跟了同位语从句，常跟同位语从句的抽象名词有：\
>>belief(信念)、fact(事实)、idea(主意)、problem(问题)、information(消息)、conclusion(结论)、decision(决定)、news(新闻)、thought(想法)、explanation(解释)等
>>
>>2. 当同位语从句充当主语过长时，同位语从句和它所修饰的名词常常隔开（避免`头重脚轻`，比如It's a fact that...）。\
>>An idea came to her that she cloud solve the problem in another way.\
>>她想到她可以用另一种方法解决问题。

### 现有语法结构体系无法解释句型

表达人的心情时常常用的句型的主干我们是比较难理解的，这一类句子当做固定句型记忆即可。e.g.

1. I'm afraid (that) he won't pass the exam.
2. We are sure that he will be successful soon.
3. I'm glad that you come to see me.

## 形容词性从句（定语从句）的起源于本质

一个句子做了形容词的功能就叫做形容词性从句。

I like that beautiful `girl` `who` can speak good English.

- `先行词`:girl
- `关系词`:who

>从句连词：who、whom、whose、that、which、as、when、where、why.

```mermaid
    graph LR;
    形容词性从句 --> 修饰人;
    形容词性从句 --> 修饰物;
    形容词性从句 --> 另类形容词;
    修饰人 --> who;
    修饰人 --> whom;
    修饰人 --> whose;
    修饰物 --> that;
    修饰物 --> which;
    修饰物 --> as;
    另类形容词 --> when;
    另类形容词 --> where;
    另类形容词 --> why;
    who -- 关系代词 --> A(This is the man who saved my life.);
    whom -- 关系代词 --> B(This is the man whom i saved.);
    whose -- 关系代词 --> C(This is the man whose life was saved by me.);
    that -- 关系代词 --> D(This is the book that i read.);
    which -- 关系代词 --> E(This is the book which is very pipular.);
    as -- 关系代词 --> F(You always work hard, as everybody knows.);
    when -- 关系副词 --> G(I can never forget the day when i met her.);
    where -- 关系副词 --> H(I can never forget the place where i met her.);
    why -- 关系副词 --> I(I can never forget the reason why she dumped me.);
```

>Tips:
>
>>1. as不可指代具体的某个词，一般指某事件，其引导的定语从句可以至于句首（其他定语从句不可以），也可以至于句末。as在定语从句中通常翻译为`正如`。
>>  
>>      e.g. A is planned, we got there before eight. (正如计划，我们在八点之前到那了。)\
>>      The won the game, as we had expected. (他们赢得了比赛，正如我们预料的那样。)
>>
>>2. 固定搭配:\
>>      such/so...as...\
>>      the same...as...\
>>      reason + why
>>
>>      e.g. He is not such a fool as he looks. (他并没有看上去那么傻。)
>>
>>3. that不出现在包含逗号`,`的定语从句中；也不和介词搭配使用。
>>
>>4. 逗号`,`出现的定语从句通常翻译为两句话。\
>>      4.1. I like the girl who is beautiful. (我喜欢这个漂亮的女孩)\
>>      4.2. I like the girl, who is beautiful. (我喜欢这个女孩，因为她漂亮)
>>
>>5. that既可以指代人，也可以指代物。通常that可以与who、whom和which互换。
>>
>>6. 关系副词when、where、why使用规则，右边必须紧跟指代时间、地点和reason，右边必须接一个完整的句子（符合五大基本句型且意义完备的句子）。
>>
>>7. 当`way`和`time`做定语从句的先行词时，关系代词常常省略。\
>>      7.1. I don't like the way (that/in which) he treated me.\
>>      7.2. The way (that/in which) he explained to us is quite simple.\
>>      7.3. This is the time (that) i come here.\
>>      7.4. This is the last time (that) i shall give you a lesson.
>>

### 限制性定语从句和非限制性定语从句

1. 限制性定语从句

    She despised people who flattered her. (她看不起那些吹捧她的人)

    定语从句“who flattered her”起到了限制先行名词的作用（即缩小名词的表示范围），归类为限制性定语从句。

2. 非限制性定语从句

    在某些场景下，先行词的指向已经是唯一的了，此时就无法再缩小这个先行词的表示范围了。所以非限制性定语从句的作用不直接修饰先行词，只为先行词提供一些补充的信息。

    I made a card for mom, who loves me most.

    所谓的非限制性定语从句，就是用逗号`,`将定语从句与先行词隔开。

### 例句3

- I like climbing mountains, which is good for my health.
- This is the room, in which i spent my whole childhood.
- The man who/that is speaking at the meeting is a worker.
- These are the trees that/which were planted last year.
- The woman whom they wanted to visit is a teacher.
- I know the girl whose mother is a teacher.
- I have a friend who/that likes listening to classical music.

## 副词型从句（状语从句）的起源于本质

一个句子做了副词的功能就叫做副词性从句。

I love you as a mouse loves rice.

> 完整句子1 + 连词 + 完整句子2  
> 其中（连词 + 完整句子2）为状语从句/副词性从句

### 副词

定义：那些修饰动词、形容词和整个句子的可有可无的成分叫做副词。

- I love you deeply.
- You are beautiful enough.
- I have breakfast every day.

>Tips:
>
>>1. 副词就是状语，状语就是副词。
>>2. 那些修饰动词、形容词和整个句子的可有可无的成分叫做副词，也叫做状语。
>>3. 除去五大基本概念和定语后剩下的成分就是副词，就是状语。
>>4. 说明时间、地点、原因、目的、结果、条件、方向、程度、方式和伴随状况等。
